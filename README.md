## Hi, welcome to Carsten's Budget Planner using the Standard 50/30/20 approach



### What does the 50/30/20 approach mean
This is the idea to spread out your income into 3 different categories, Needs, Wants, and Savings, and to split your income accordingly. You should spend around 50% of your income on Needs, for example housing and food. You should spend around 30% of your income on Wants, for example a phone bill and dining out. You should put around 20% of your income into Savings, for example a retirement fund and an emergency fund. 



### How do I open the website
After you have downloaded/cloned this project simply open up the budget-planner.html program in your browser. 



### How do I use the website
The first thing you should do is insert the amount of money you make per month, this value will help us base the amount you should spend on each category. 
Next you should fill out the Needs column with how much you are spending on your needs, like Housing/Food. Continue filling out the Wants and Savings column, and do not worry about trying to make sure it adds up now as the next part will help show that.
Press the calculate budget button which will then find your actual total amount of money you spend per month and compare it to the actual amount of money you get, how close/off were you?
Below this you will then see the total amount of money you spent on each category and how much actual percent it took up.
Using this total we will compare it to the standard 50/30/20 grouping to show you how much money you should be spending and the difference between what you are now and what you should be aiming for.
